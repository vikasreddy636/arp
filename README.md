# program composd by two processes using pipe
In this program the user inputs two numbers A and B, random signal is sent through the pipe, every time when a signal is sent it computes the sum  of A and B and increment with respect to last time and the out put is stored in a log file
# installing and running
Machine requires a python 3 installation and the required libraries are pandas,time,datetime,random and string.
script to install required libraries

$ pip3 install pandas && pip3 install time && pip3 install datetime && pip3 install random && pip3 install string

Once the libraries are installed, run the script using $ python3 c1.py

# About the code
Two numbers a&b should be entered by the user and the program generates the random letters, which we are using as signals. After generating of each letter a loop of program excutes and the sum of a&b are incermented, this loop continious until the random letter generates "z" or "Z". And the output log of the program is displayed in shell and stored in a .xlsx file.
